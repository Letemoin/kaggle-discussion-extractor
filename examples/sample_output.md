Hello, everyone,

We (ML & polymer researchers from the University of Notre Dame and the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison) are excited to present this challenge to you. Machine learning (ML) techniques such as sequence-to-sequence models and graph neural networks have transformed many fields, including chat services and recommender systems.

Dedicated ML models for polymer discovery have received less attention because high-quality open-source polymer data are rare. Unlike images or text, annotating polymers requires specialized expertise...

Hello @alexliu99!
Could you please provide more details about the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations used to generate the data? Specifically, I'm interested in the software, force field, integrator, time step, ensemble type, temperatures, cooling rate for Tg, chain length, whether polydispersity was considered, and other relevant parameters.

  @alexliu99 Can we please have any details on the MD simulations? It is essential to know at least some basic parameters (polymer length, temperature, force field) you used if we hope to integrate any physics-based methods into our submission.

If molecular dynamic simulation can predict the required properties why use Machine learning?

  It's likely to decrease the time and computational (power) resource consumption. Molecular dynamics can be very precise but is relatively slow, compared to Machine Learning (less precise but faster). It's a tradeoff but one that could speed up the screening of potential candidates for more precise MD calculations.
